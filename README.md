# React Cart System

* This is a simple cart system made using react framework.

## Description

This is an app made using react which showcases how react component can be used to build a user friendly experience with instant visual updates and scalable code in ecommerce applications.

## Work flow of the react components:

> App.js
>> Navbar.js <br>
>> Cart.js 
>>>  Cartitem.js
 

### Requirements-

* Node.js
* NPM

### Features:

* Add and remove product from floating cart.
* Functionable increase and decrease buttons.
* Functionable delete button.
* Showing the total count in the cart.
* Totaling the amount of the items in cart. 

# How to get started with the app ?

* Clone the repository on your system from [here](https://github.com/vishwajeet-hash/cartsystem).
* Open the project folder and install the required dependencies by running this command on terminal:
```
npm install
```
* Start the project simply by writing this code :
```
npm start
```

## Commands that you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
